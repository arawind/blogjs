Words

Found this gem on [Terribly Tiny Tales](https://www.facebook.com/terriblytinytales/photos/a.165472426936286.1073741825.139884892828373/583134348503423/). Written by Amrit Paul

One day, words would make sense.
Words would stand at ease.
Words would help cross roads under the red lights.
Letters would kiss in the folds of turned pages.
Letters would fall in love. Hopelessly.
They would ride in tunes. Swim in hues.
Words would smear ink.Throw vowels. Shoot commas.
Words would kill. And die.
You'd fall for words.
Rise for them.
You'd kiss them asleep.
Feel them breathe.
You'd forget some. Meet more.
Call them by wrong names. And implore?
One day, dots of i's and dashes of t's,
Rounds of o's, valleys of v's
Would run away.
Shallow saddles and crooked curves,
blunt bottoms and cheerful crosses
would
part for whole
of their lives.
One day, words would make sense.
Words would stand at ease.
And miss the attention.
