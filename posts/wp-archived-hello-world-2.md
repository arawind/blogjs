Hello world!
------------
Hello world!

I really don't know what I'm doing on wordpress creating a new blog while I should be reading for my test tomorrow... A way of stress release? Nah. I'm getting more stressed thinking what should I be putting on the blog as my first post! Lol.. Really now, I wonder how do people get addicted to blogs!

Half an hour and a zillion backspaces.. and I just proceeded to the second paragraph.

This is lame.

Will be back if I have a new idea/inspiration.. Or, this post is going to be the first and last of my blogging experience!

signing off,
