Sem Log: Day 3
--------------
Day 3:

<a title="Vim-Post on GitHub" href="http://github.com/arawind/vim-post" target="_blank">vim-post</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finished adding cookies support.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Added comments for readability (hey, they mayn't be perfect but there are some!)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Still need to work on writing a wiki that explains it all.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How about publishing WordPress posts through vim? It's possible, but the sheer thought of having to write so much html.. Hey, why not replace the entire thing which auto-puts html! Should work on this. A self-pat-on-the-back for thinking this..</p>
wiki-tree: Resuming work. Shall see where d3js will lead me to.
