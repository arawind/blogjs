Sem Log: Day 2
--------------
<p>Day 2:</p>
<p>Not much work again, but I need to make a wiki/post for the <a title="Vim-Post" href="http://github.com/arawind/vim-post" target="_blank">vim-post</a> plugin, starting work on that</p>
<p>vim-post:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Adding a file cookie handler</p>
<p>linuxdcpp, my gtk version seems to have a problem, not being able to accept new 'share' folders. Supposedly a bug in gtk3. Temporarily solved by editing the ~/.dc++/DCPlusPlus.xml</p>
