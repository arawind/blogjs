Holiday Log: Day 1
------------------
Holidays at last!

During the last bout of my exams, I've made some to-do-list and topping that list is "Write a daily log". So here goes..

Day 1:

4 hours to ruthlessly delete all backups (and backups of backups too..) freeing up a massive amount of space!! I then removed the Ubuntu partition, merged it along Â with a new partition I made to install Arch Linux. I've just completed the installation and for once I can say that OS installation is fun!
