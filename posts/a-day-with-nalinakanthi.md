A day with Nalinakanthi
-----------------------

While browsing through Youtube suggestions early in the morning, I came across this beautiful Acappella in the suggestions.

It was the second time I was listening to this, and it immediately went into loop-until-infinity stage. The arrangement is a mix of different compositions with smooth transitions overlapping each other. The Kandukonden Kandukonden part gives it the familarity which should help anyone to connect. I enjoyed every part of this!

I was completely addicted to the raaga and I needed more of it! Manavinalakincharadate comes to the rescue!

I first came to know of the Nalinakanthi raaga through this composition. I fell in love with it so much, I had it playing multiple times everyday for a week. The slow beats, the smooth pitches of the violin singing the raaga, the konnakol..., all of them seduce you with their graceful notes, take you to the climax and makes you wonder when it finishes, at what point you lost yourself and started dancing.

I took it up a notch further and immersed myself in this rendition which needs no words:

The Acappella had this lovely "Nalinakanthimathim" part which was stuck in my mind. Trying to get more of it, I found this soulful Raagam Taanam Pallavi by Sanjay Subrahmanyan.

I don't think I am able to put in words, the immense happiness this raaga and these compositions bring within me. It has this strong attraction which makes me want to surround myself with it.

Here is a playlist I've made for this raaga with the videos I enjoyed on Youtube. Will keep adding more as I find them
