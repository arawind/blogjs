Winsome Tulip
-----
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. 
One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! 
And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. 
For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.

-An _unknown_ 20th century poet :wink:
